Due to filesize limitations on backup, gfdl results are stored in 3 separate 
files for each experiment. T and Q (3-D variables) are stored individually,
and the remaining variables (which are 2-D) needed for kernel analysis are
in the "2Dvars" files. 

This nuance is only for GFDL output because of higher model resolution.
